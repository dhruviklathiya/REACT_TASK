For easiness of setting up project on local environment,
I haven't attached .gitignore file.

=> Steps
- - - Clone the repo to your local machine
- - - Locate folder you clone from terminal or command line
- - - Give following command: npm start
- - - You're good to go, this will automatically open up browser tab which will have perfectly working project.
